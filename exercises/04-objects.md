# `04` Objects Exercises

A feature that all cloud providers *have* to offer is an S3-compatible object storage. At cloudscale.ch, we call our object storage "Objects". Our object storage is powered by RADOS Gateway, a Ceph service that offers an S3-compatible API to store and retrieve objects. Customers use the object storage for serving big files, website artifacts, Docker images, etc.

There are a lot of things that can be done with S3, for example offering an upload form for anonymous users. As an engineer at cloudscale.ch you should at least be familiar with `s3cmd` and `aws s3api`, both CLIs designed to deal with S3 services.

## ðŸŽ“ Exercises

### `04.01` - s3cmd

Using `s3cmd`, create a bucket, upload a file, and make it publicly accessible.

---

### `04.02` - AWS CLI

Create a bucket using `aws s3api`, enable objects versioning and upload a file several times, slightly changing its content each time. Can you recover a previous version of the file? What do you need to do in order to delete the bucket again?
