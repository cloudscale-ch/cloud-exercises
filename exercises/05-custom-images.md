# `05` Custom Images Exercises

Even though we offer a number of "off the shelf" images (like Ubuntu, Debian, or CentOS), it is often useful or even necessary to use one's own custom image. This is done by generating a disk image using a separate tool, uploading it to our object storage, and importing it as a custom image.

It is also possible to create a separate volume and copy an image there. This volume can then be used as a rescue image.
